Notes of the implementation document: 
1. Resolution: 
    While executing variables need a resolution document 

2. Allocating Memory 
    Global counter next_available
    - Insert (t.lexeme, next_available) in to the symbol table and increment pointer
    INPUT: return a data structure of a list of num inputs to be used later
        - There should be no duplicate inputs and entries should be initialized to 0
        - This functionality is similar for assign and output 
    EXECUTE: all variables here need memory allocated 
    INPUTS: Need to be stored in a vector/array
        - atoi() functional
